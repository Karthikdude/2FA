# Flask 2FA Authentication

This is a simple Flask application that demonstrates two-factor authentication (2FA) using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) and QR codes. Users can register, log in, and use a TOTP-based 2FA to secure their accounts.

## Features

- User registration with username and password.
- User login with password.
- Two-factor authentication using TOTP.
- QR code generation for 2FA setup.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- pyotp
- qrcode

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karthikdude/2FA
   cd 2FA
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install Flask pyotp qrcode
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser and navigate to:**

   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` - Home page
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/register` - Register a new user
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login` - Log in
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/2fa` - Two-factor authentication

## How It Works

1. **Registration:**
   - Users register with a username and password.
   - A TOTP secret is generated for the user and stored in memory.

2. **Login:**
   - Users log in with their username and password.
   - If the credentials are correct, they are redirected to the 2FA page.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication:**
   - Users enter the OTP generated by their authenticator app.
   - The application verifies the OTP against the stored TOTP secret.

4. **QR Code Generation:**
   - A QR code is generated and displayed for the user to scan with their authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator).

## Notes

- The application uses an in-memory dictionary (`users`) to store user data. For production use, consider using a database.
- The `secret_key` is used for session management. Change it to a more secure key in a real application.
- Ensure that your application is secure and handle sensitive information appropriately.
